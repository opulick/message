                    <h2>Issue</h2>
                   <p>There has been a rapid decline in the bee population, 40% loss of commercial bee in the United States alone. Europe Has been keeping a track on the decline since the late 1990's.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="cause">
                    <h2>Source</h2>
                    <p>Why bees are on the decline? Pesticides, climate change, parasites/pathogens, or industrial agriculture. These are all reason for the bees are going extinct.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="solution">
                    <h2>Solution</h2>
                    <p>We can prevent the bees from going extinct. 3 easy steps such as support bee farming, stop industrial agriculture, and outlaw the bee killing pesticides.</p>

                    <h2>Bee Facts</h2>
                    <p>Honey bees and bumblebees have been around for about 30 million years. There are only 7 species of honey bee that is recognized and are are 44 total subspecies. Honey bees and bumble beer are social workers and they live together.  Bees are essential for keeping alive the ecosystem. However most bees are solitary. Both honey bees and bumblebees have one queen and workers. The honey beers have about thousands workers, mostly female workers with a small portion of male workers. The bumble bees have a much smaller nest as small as few hundred.</p>
                    <p>The honey bees navigate through the hair on their eyes. The hair on their eyes can sense the wind current and it helps them assist in navigation. Have you noticed that their eyes are hexagonal just like the bee hives. They are able to distribute pollen evenly on their hind legs.</p>

                    <h2>Problem is Pesticides</h2>
                    <p>We live in world that is ever growing. One of the hardest worker is the bees and they are dying with our help of the harmful pesticides. The industrial agriculture uses many different pesticides but insecticides are purposeful made to kill the insects.</p>
                    <p>Below are the effects that these insecticides have on bees</p>
                    <ol>
                         <li>
                            1. Physiological effects that affects the bees development rate.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            2. It has a effect on the foraging pattern. Tis means that the bees are struggling learning and navigation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            3. It interferes with the bee feeding behavior.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            4. It impacts the bee on their learning process through the neurotoxic pesticides.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Take Action! Plant</h2>
                    <p>
                    You can easily help the bees with planting native wildflowers or even planting flower shrubs. Even if you have a balcony you can help pot flowers. You can place a medium size basket with herbs, veggies, or flowers. This basket will bring more color to you balcony. If you can stop mowing your lawn in spots, you will be surprised of which flowers will appear there. Also let the tiny dandelions live. They are one of the richest in pollen and the first ones to sprout up and the last ones to leave. These are just some simple ideas you can start to do to help those little workers.
